// LEVEL 4
Hey there!
I didn't know you were in the mazes.
So, have you figured it out yet?
I meant the maze, not like, life or anything...

// LEVEL 5
Want to hear a SPECIAL TIP?
If you collect all the bananas in a certain level...
...I will grant you three wishes!
What?
No, I am not a genie.

// LEVEL 6
Sometimes, barriers are invisible.
So that means you have to go around and find them.
That's why I've been stuck in this room for the past 17 hours.

// LEVEL 7
Have you found the bananas yet?
Remember, I'll give you wishes!
...
In the mean time, check out this brick.

// LEVEL 8
Sorry to disturb you, but I am getting a little hungry.
And YOU haven't found a SINGLE banana!
Do you want me to starve?

// LEVEL 9
I found an apple (yuck), and ate it.
Now I am no longer hungry, so I can give you more tips!
TIP #1: Always eat with your mouth closed!

// LEVEL 10
Hey, this level is a little challenging.
Maybe you should, I don't know, quit?
You know what? I'll close the game for you.
(boss battle begins)
AND MAKE SURE IT NEVER REOPENS AGAIN.
ALL I WANTED WAS A BANANA, WAS THAT TO MUCH TO ASK?
I STARVE DOWN HERE IN THE MAZES!
HUNGER AILS ME NIGHT AND DAY...
...SO WHY...
...DO YOU...
...SIT BACK AND WATCH!?
